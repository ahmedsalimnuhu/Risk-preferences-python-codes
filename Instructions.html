        <b> You will be asked a number of repeated choices to make. Specifically {{n}} choices. </b>
        <p></p>
        <b> You will only have the chance of being paid for one of the choices you make in this exercise.Â </b>
    However, you do not know yet which choice set it will be, so you must think about
    each choice of Option A and Option B very carefully. <p></p>

You will only find out at the end of Part III for which of these questions you
        are going to have the chance of being paid. So, it is in your interest to treat
        each of the {{n}} choice sets to be presented as if that is the question
        for which you are going to have the chance of being paid.
